## Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## Objective
Clean and prepare the Titanic dataset for machine learning.

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset
- Handled missing values (Age, Embarked), dropped Cabin
- Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)
- Normalized numerical features using Min-Max scaling
- Visualized and removed outliers using IQR method
- Exported cleaned data to `titanic_cleaned.csv`

## Output Files
- `AI_ML_Task1_Data_Cleaning.ipynb`
- `titanic_cleaned.csv`

# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
Explore and understand the Titanic dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations.

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly

## Steps Performed
- Generated summary statistics for all features
- Plotted histograms and boxplots for numerical columns
- Created a correlation heatmap and pairplot to observe relationships
- Built an interactive scatter plot (Age vs Fare) using Plotly
- Identified key patterns such as survival based on age, fare, and class

## Output Files
- `AI_ML_Task2_EDA.ipynb`: Notebook with all analysis and visualizations
